# Digital Media Storytelling Project - Loot Boxes in Board Games

This repo holds the source code for a web app companion of a satire on loot boxes in video games. The satire heavily relies on materials from Fantasy Flight Game's Imperial Assault board game to reimagine EA's Star Wars Battlefront II as a board game, including the exceedingly controversial gamble-to-win loot box system. The goal of this project is to accentuate the incredulity and ridiculousness of loot boxes in general, by tying them to a physical medium that makes it harder to forget how terrible they are. This repo, in particular, houses the loot box portion of the game itself, where players actually spend their money.

** Note: This project is considered a prototype. No information is collected or stored in any way, and some areas of the app do not even do anything. It is meant as a proof-of-concept only
