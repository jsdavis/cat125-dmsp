        <h3>Dice Boxes</h3>
        <p class="small">You can purchase a <b>dice box</b> any time you are about to make an <b>attack</b> roll, with any weapon. For $1.00, you can replace your dice pool with the results of opening one of these boxes, with a chance to roll 4 or more dice! Only one dice box can be purchased per attack action.<br><a href="dice_loot.html">Buy a dice box</a></p>

        <h3>Weapon Boxes</h3>
        <p class="small">You can purchase <b>weapon boxes</b> between rounds of combat. For $2.00, open a box with potentially very powerful weapons! There is no limit to how many weapon boxes you can purchase in a single game, so keep trying to get the best gear!<br><a href="weapon_loot.html">Buy a weapon box</a></p>

        <h3>Deployment Boxes</h3>
        <p class="small"><b>Deployment boxes</b> can be purchased either at the beginning of a game or when redeploying a group. For just $3.00, you have a chance to replace a lowly stormtrooper group with the legendary Darth Vader! Just like weapon boxes, there are no limits here!<br><a href="unit_loot.html">Buy a deployment box</a></p>
